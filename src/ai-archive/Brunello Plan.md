### Executive Summary

This guide provides scientifically-validated protocols for producing exceptional natural Brunello di Montalcino through absolute minimal intervention. Each recommendation is calibrated for:
- **100% Sangiovese** as required by Brunello DOCG regulations
- **Minimum 2 years oak + 4 months bottle aging** (5 years total for Riserva)
- **Galestro soil** conditions at 300m elevation
- **Ultra-low sulfur** philosophy (10ppm at crush only)
- **12-year spontaneous fermentation** heritage

All protocols meet or exceed the strictest natural wine standards globally, ensuring your wines could qualify for any certification while focusing on quality over bureaucracy.

### Section 1: Mycorrhizal Network Cultivation for Sangiovese on Galestro

#### Scientific Foundation

Arbuscular mycorrhizal fungi (AMF) colonization specifically benefits Sangiovese cultivation. Research on Sangiovese vines demonstrates that *Funneliformis mosseae* inoculation increases volatile organic compounds crucial for wine quality¹. In Mediterranean climates similar to Montalcino, AMF colonization provides 40% improvement in water stress tolerance - critical for Sangiovese's tendency toward high vigor².

Galestro's friable clay-schist structure with pH 7.5-8.0 provides ideal conditions for mycorrhizal establishment, as demonstrated in Chianti Classico studies³.

#### Implementation Protocol for Brunello Vineyards

**Year 1 - Initial Inoculation (Specific to Your Parcels):**

**30-year-old vines (established):**
- Apply 25g/vine of native AMF inoculum in March
- Focus on *Rhizoglomus intraradices* for mature vine disease resistance
- Expected colonization: 40-50% within 6 months
- No soil disturbance deeper than 10cm to preserve networks

**10-year-old vines (developing):**
- Apply 35g/vine targeting 60% colonization
- Mix *F. mosseae* and *R. intraradices* equally
- Critical for quality improvement during peak production years
- Monitor monthly using gridline intersect method

**6-year-old vines (young):**
- Apply 50g/vine for rapid network establishment
- Young vines respond fastest to inoculation
- Avoid phosphorus fertilization which inhibits colonization

**March replanting protocol:**
- Pre-inoculate roots with 100g AMF mix per vine
- Ensure galestro soil temperature >10°C at planting
- Plant material must be from massal selection, not clonal
- Water only with non-chlorinated water first season

#### Expected Outcomes for Brunello Production
- Enhanced Sangiovese aromatics (specifically cherry and violet notes)
- Improved tannin polymerization during mandatory 2+ year aging
- Natural protection against esca and grapevine trunk diseases
- 30-40% reduced irrigation needs preserving Brunello typicity
- Increased wine complexity measurable after 18 months aging

### Section 2: Indigenous Yeast Optimization for Long-Aging Wines

#### Scientific Foundation

Brunello's extended aging requires robust fermentation to prevent volatile acidity development. Research from Montalcino shows indigenous *Saccharomyces cerevisiae* populations produce 23% higher glycerol content than commercial yeasts, crucial for Brunello's texture after 2+ years aging⁴. Natural fermentation produces higher levels of mannoproteins that stabilize color during extended oak aging - essential when working with only 10ppm SO2⁵.

#### Implementation Protocol for Brunello Fermentation

**Pied de cuve preparation (Brunello-specific):**
1. **Timing**: Start 5 days before each parcel's harvest
2. **Selection**: 100kg best Sangiovese from oldest vines
3. **Crushing**: By foot or gentle roller, no destemming
4. **Temperature**: Maintain 22°C (optimal for Sangiovese indigenous yeasts)
5. **Monitoring**: Check every 8 hours - pH, Brix, sensory
6. **Readiness indicators**:
   - 3-4° Brix drop achieved
   - VA <0.3 g/L (critical threshold)
   - Active bubbling visible
   - Clean fermentation aroma (no H2S)

**Fermentation management for age-worthy structure:**
- Days 1-3: 20°C to preserve Sangiovese's delicate fruit
- Days 4-12: 26°C maximum (higher destroys aging potential)
- Days 13-25: 24°C for gentle tannin polymerization
- Days 26-35: 22°C extended maceration for structure
- Total maceration: 30-35 days for Brunello requirements

**Critical parameters for 10ppm SO2 protocol:**
- pH must remain <3.5 throughout (measure daily)
- Temperature control essential - no spikes above 28°C ever
- Dissolved oxygen <2mg/L during active fermentation
- Complete MLF within 60 days to minimize VA risk
- No additions except 10ppm SO2 at crush

#### Risk Mitigation for Extended Aging
- Maintain three separate pied de cuve from different parcels
- Monitor VA every 48 hours during fermentation
- If VA exceeds 0.4 g/L, cool to 18°C immediately
- Never exceed 0.6 g/L VA (wine becomes unmarketable)
- Keep detailed fermentation charts for each tank

### Section 3: Whole Cluster Adaptation for Brunello DOCG

#### Scientific Foundation

While Burgundy successfully uses 30-100% whole clusters, Sangiovese's different phenolic structure requires careful adaptation. Research from Tuscany shows 15-20% whole cluster inclusion optimal for Sangiovese, providing complexity without excessive tannins that become aggressive during extended aging⁶. Stem lignification in Sangiovese occurs 2-3 weeks later than Pinot Noir, requiring patience⁷.

#### Brunello-Specific Whole Cluster Protocol

**Maximum whole cluster percentage by vine age:**
- 30-year vines: 20% maximum (best stem maturity)
- 10-year vines: 15% maximum  
- 6-year vines: 10% maximum (younger vines = greener stems)
- Never exceed these percentages for Sangiovese

**Sangiovese stem assessment (September):**
1. **Visual**: 90%+ brown coloration (vs 80% for Pinot)
2. **Physical**: Stems snap cleanly, no bending
3. **Aromatic**: No green/vegetal aroma when chewed
4. **Timing**: Usually 7-10 days after optimal berry ripeness

**Fermentation adjustments for whole cluster Brunello:**
1. Layer whole clusters in middle third of fermenter only
2. Extended cold soak: 72 hours at 12°C (longer than Burgundy)
3. CO2 blanket essential during cold soak
4. First punch-down only after 5 days (preserve whole berries)
5. Gentle extractions - 2 punch-downs daily maximum
6. Total maceration: 30-35 days for structure

#### Impact on Brunello Aging
- Whole cluster stems provide natural pH buffering during 2+ years
- Stem tannins polymerize beneficially after 18 months
- Enhanced complexity emerges in year 2 of aging
- Adds "Burgundian" silkiness to Sangiovese's natural austerity
- Critical: excess whole cluster destroys Brunello typicity

### Section 4: Ultra-Low Sulfur Protocol for Extended Aging

#### Scientific Foundation

Brunello's mandatory extended aging presents unique challenges for minimal SO2 use. Research demonstrates wines with <20ppm total SO2 can achieve 10+ year ageability through proper phenolic management and pH control⁸. Sangiovese's naturally high acidity (typical pH 3.2-3.4) provides inherent antimicrobial protection⁹.

#### Brunello-Specific SO2 Management

**Your 10ppm at crush protocol - precise application:**
1. **Preparation**: Dissolve SO2 in small amount of must first
2. **Application timing**: During destemming, not after
3. **Distribution method**: Spray solution evenly during crushing
4. **Temperature requirement**: Must below 20°C during addition
5. **pH verification**: Confirm <3.4 before any SO2 addition
6. **Documentation**: Record exact amount, time, temperature

**Compensation strategies for 2+ years aging without additional SO2:**
- Dissolved oxygen target: <0.2 mg/L (stricter than conventional)
- Temperature control: 12-14°C constant throughout aging
- Barrel topping: Every 10 days first year, biweekly second year
- Complete lees contact for 12 months (natural antioxidants)
- Inert gas (argon preferred) for every movement
- No racking unless absolutely necessary

**Brunello bottling without additional SO2:**
- Natural cork quality critical - test every lot for TCA
- Vacuum corking essential (<1% oxygen in headspace)
- DIAM cork alternative if TCA risk too high
- Bottle aging at 14-16°C for minimum 4 months
- Accept 2-3% bottle variation as natural expression

#### Monthly Stability Monitoring
- pH (target 3.2-3.5)
- Volatile acidity (<0.6 g/L)
- Free SO2 (will decline from initial 10ppm)
- Dissolved oxygen (<0.2 mg/L)
- Microbiological stability (plate counts)
- Molecular SO2 (calculate from pH and free SO2)

### Section 5: Cover Crop Systems for Montalcino Terroir

#### Scientific Foundation

Montalcino's Mediterranean climate (600mm annual rainfall, severe summer drought) requires specific cover crop strategies. Research from Chianti demonstrates appropriate cover crops reduce Sangiovese vigor by 25% while improving must quality parameters¹⁰. Galestro soils benefit particularly from nitrogen-fixing species due to naturally low organic matter content (typically <2%)¹¹.

#### Brunello Vineyard Cover Crop Protocol

**Species selection optimized for galestro soils:**
- 40% Subterranean clover (*Trifolium subterraneum*) - self-reseeding, drought tolerant
- 30% Annual fescue (*Festuca annua*) - low water competition
- 20% Field beans (*Vicia faba minor*) - 60kg N/ha fixation
- 10% Barley (*Hordeum vulgare*) - quick organic matter

**Management timeline for Montalcino climate:**
1. **October** (post-harvest): Seed at 60kg/ha after first rain
2. **February**: Assess growth, no intervention needed
3. **March**: Mow alternate rows only if excessive (>40cm)
4. **April**: Roll/crimp before flowering to create mulch
5. **May-September**: Maintain as dead mulch for water retention

**Parcel-specific adjustments:**
- Young vines (6yr): 40kg/ha only - minimize competition
- Mature vines (10-30yr): Full 60kg/ha rate
- Steep slopes: Add 20% more barley for erosion control
- Replanting areas: No cover crop years 1-2

#### Expected Impact on Brunello Quality
- Berry size reduction: 15-20% (concentration effect)
- Must nitrogen: Maintained at optimal 140-180mg/L
- Soil organic matter: 0.5% annual increase
- Water holding capacity: 20% improvement after 3 years
- Natural vigor control eliminating need for hedging

### Section 6: Zero-Copper Disease Management for DOCG Compliance

#### Scientific Foundation

Montalcino's humidity (especially April-June) creates significant disease pressure requiring intervention. Recent studies demonstrate botanical extracts achieve 70% efficacy compared to copper for downy mildew control¹². Combining multiple botanicals with biocontrol agents can achieve commercially acceptable protection while maintaining natural principles¹³.

#### Disease Management Without Copper or Synthetics

**Primary spray program (April-July):**

**Week 1 rotation - Downy mildew focus:**
- Horsetail decoction (*Equisetum*): 1kg dried/10L water
- Ferment 14 days before use
- Application: 300L/ha (adjust for slope)
- Timing: Dawn application for optimal absorption
- Efficacy: 60-70% vs untreated

**Week 2 rotation - Powdery mildew focus:**
- Orange oil (d-limonene): 3ml/L 
- Plus potassium bicarbonate: 5g/L
- Critical during flowering (May-June)
- Avoid application above 25°C
- Efficacy: 75-80% vs untreated

**Week 3 rotation - Biological control:**
- *Trichoderma harzianum*: 10⁸ spores/ha
- Establishes endophytic colonization
- Persists 20-30 days on Sangiovese leaves
- Compatible with all botanical sprays
- Preventive action only

**Week 4 rotation - Protective film:**
- Propolis extract: 2ml/L
- Plus bentonite clay: 10g/L suspension
- Creates physical barrier
- Reapply after 20mm rain
- Acceptable for all regulations

#### Emergency Interventions (If Disease Exceeds 5%)
- Chitosan: 2g/L (maximum 3 applications/season)
- Essential oil blend: Oregano (0.5ml/L) + thyme (0.5ml/L)
- Whey: 10% solution for powdery mildew
- Accept 10-15% yield loss rather than compromise principles
- Document losses for DOCG authorities

#### Realistic Expectations
- Target: 85% of conventional protection level
- Accept: 10-20% yield variation between years
- Monitor: Weekly scouting essential
- Document: Every application for transparency

### Section 7: Manual Precision Viticulture for Brunello Quality

#### Scientific Foundation

Brunello's single-variety requirement makes within-parcel differentiation crucial for complexity. Manual precision viticulture achieves 85% of technology-based results through systematic observation¹⁴. Galestro's variable depth (0.5-2m) creates natural vigor zones ideal for selective harvesting and quality segregation¹⁵.

#### Brunello Parcel Management Without Technology

**Zone identification for each parcel:**

**June assessment (peak vegetative growth):**
1. Create 20m x 20m grid with stakes
2. Count shoots per meter of cordon
3. Measure average internode length
4. Assess leaf layers at fruit zone
5. Map three distinct zones:
   - Low vigor: <10 shoots/meter, short internodes
   - Medium vigor: 10-15 shoots/meter, optimal
   - High vigor: >15 shoots/meter, excessive growth

**Harvest timing by zone (September-October):**
- **Low vigor zones**: Harvest first
  - Higher concentration but lower acidity
  - Ideal for Brunello structure
  - Pick at 24-25 Brix
  
- **Medium vigor zones**: Optimal quality
  - Perfect balance for Brunello
  - Pick at 23-24 Brix
  - Best complexity potential
  
- **High vigor zones**: Harvest last or declassify
  - Often better suited for Rosso
  - Risk of green characters
  - May need longer hang time

**Quality segregation for Brunello vs Rosso:**
- Best 60% of production → Brunello
- Next 30% → Rosso di Montalcino  
- Remaining 10% → Declassify or bulk
- Never compromise Brunello quality for yield

#### Data Collection Without Digital Tools
- Hand-drawn maps with consistent grid reference
- Photos from identical positions monthly
- 100-berry samples per zone weekly from veraison
- Detailed harvest journal with:
  - Date, zone, yield, Brix, pH, TA
  - Weather conditions
  - Sensory notes
  - Fermentation observations

### Section 8: Oak Vessel Protocol for Brunello's Extended Aging

#### Scientific Foundation

Brunello requires minimum 2 years in oak per DOCG regulations. Research shows that combining French and Slavonian oak creates superior complexity - French oak (Quercus petraea) provides elegant vanilla and spice notes through lactone compounds, while Slavonian oak (Quercus robur) offers neutral maturation with gentle tannin integration¹⁶. DRC's approach of 95-100% new French oak for 16-18 months³² demonstrates that extended new oak contact requires exceptional fruit concentration. For Sangiovese, a more nuanced approach balancing both oak types achieves Burgundian elegance without overwhelming the variety's delicate aromatics.

#### Brunello-Specific Oak Protocol

**Traditional Vessel Selection:**
- **French oak tonneaux (500L)**: Larger format than Burgundy's 228L provides gentler integration
- **Slavonian oak botti (20-30HL)**: Traditional for Brunello, provides oxidative evolution without flavor
- **Combination approach**: Proven by producers like Talenti using 60% French tonneaux, 40% Slavonian⁵⁴

**Year 1 (Months 1-12) - Primary Structure Development:**

**French Oak Component (50% of production):**
- 500L tonneaux (not 228L barriques - too aggressive for Sangiovese)
- Toast level: Medium to medium-plus (never heavy)
- Oak age mix:
  - 20% new oak (maximum for natural philosophy)
  - 30% second-use (1-2 years old)
  - 50% third-use or older (3-5 years)
- Purpose: Gentle spice integration, mid-palate texture

**Slavonian Oak Component (50% of production):**
- 20-30HL traditional botti
- Minimum 5 years old (preferably 10+)
- No flavor extraction, pure oxidative evolution
- Maintains Sangiovese's cherry/violet character
- Traditional thickness: 5-7cm for optimal micro-oxygenation

**Year 2 (Months 13-24) - Integration and Refinement:**

**Racking and Blending Protocol:**
- Month 12: First racking and initial blending trials
- Combine French and Slavonian components
- Transfer to:
  - 70% neutral Slavonian botti (10+ years old)
  - 30% older French tonneaux (5+ years old)
- Purpose: Harmonization without additional oak impact

**Creating Burgundian Touch:**
- French oak provides lifted aromatics and silky texture
- Slavonian preserves fruit purity and terroir expression
- The combination creates complexity without domination
- Similar to DRC's philosophy but adapted for Sangiovese's lower concentration

#### Temperature and Humidity Management

**Optimal conditions throughout aging:**
- Temperature: 14-16°C constant (cooler than typical 18°C)
- Humidity: 75-80% to minimize evaporation
- Natural caves ideal, otherwise climate-controlled
- Monitor "angel's share": Target <3% annual loss

#### Topping and Maintenance Protocol

**Year 1 (Higher attention needed):**
- Top every 10 days first 6 months
- Bi-weekly months 7-12
- Use same wine from same vessels for topping
- Never use SO2 in topping wine

**Year 2 (Stabilization period):**
- Top monthly
- Minimal disturbance
- Natural clarification occurring
- No movement unless essential

#### Vessel Selection Criteria

**French Oak Sourcing (Burgundian approach):**
- Forests: Allier, Tronçais, or Vosges (tighter grain)
- Air-dried minimum 24 months (36 preferred)
- Medium toast with slow, gentle fire
- Cooperages used by Burgundy producers preferred

**Slavonian Oak Tradition:**
- Source: Croatian highlands (traditional for Brunello)
- Minimum 4-year air drying
- Assembled using traditional methods
- Capacity: 20-30HL optimal for small production

#### Pre-Bottling (Months 24-26) - Assembly:
- Blend components in neutral Slavonian botti
- Natural cold stabilization if needed (12°C for 3 weeks)
- No fining agents ever
- No filtration (achieve <4 NTU naturally)
- Gravity transfer only
- Rest 2 months before bottling

#### Expected Evolution Timeline

**Months 1-6**: Primary fruit preserved, gentle oak integration beginning
**Months 7-12**: Tannin polymerization, color stabilization
**Months 13-18**: Oak integration complete, complexity building
**Months 19-24**: Full harmonization, tertiary notes developing
**Months 24+**: Ready for bottling, showing both elegance and structure

#### Quality Markers for Success

- No dominant oak flavors at any stage
- Preserved cherry/violet Sangiovese character
- Silky tannin texture by month 18
- Natural clarity achieved by month 24
- Color evolution from ruby to garnet edge
- pH stability throughout (3.3-3.5)

#### Cost-Benefit Analysis

**Investment required:**
- French tonneaux (500L): €800-1200 each
- Slavonian botti (25HL): €3000-5000 each
- Lifespan: French 8-10 years, Slavonian 20+ years
- Quality premium justifies investment

### Section 9: Natural Clarification Timeline for Brunello

#### Scientific Foundation

Brunello's extended aging provides sufficient time for complete natural clarification. Studies demonstrate 24+ months aging achieves <4 NTU turbidity without any filtration¹⁸. Sangiovese's robust tannin structure naturally precipitates during extended aging, eliminating need for fining agents¹⁹.

#### Natural Clarification Protocol

**Months 1-6 (Full lees contact):**
- Weekly bâtonnage first month only
- Monthly bâtonnage months 2-6
- Temperature: 14-16°C constant
- Builds structure and complexity
- Mannoproteins provide natural stability

**Months 7-12 (Partial lees):**
- First racking only if reduction detected
- Keep fine lees, remove only gross lees
- Natural protein precipitation occurring
- Tartrate crystals beginning to form
- Monitor but don't intervene

**Months 13-24 (Oak aging):**
- Single racking at month 18 if needed
- Natural cold stabilization happening
- Tannin polymerization continuing
- Color becoming stable
- Clarity improving naturally

**Months 24-26 (Pre-bottling):**
- Target: <4 NTU turbidity
- If >4 NTU: Wait additional 3 months
- Never fine (no egg whites, bentonite, etc.)
- Never filter (pad, cartridge, or membrane)
- Accept natural sediment in bottle

#### Quality Assurance Without Intervention
- Visual assessment monthly with candle
- Microscopic examination quarterly for microbes
- Taste for reduction (H₂S, mercaptans) biweekly
- Measure turbidity only at month 24
- Trust time over technology
